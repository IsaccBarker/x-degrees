            <h4>Okay, now that thats out of the way, what is this for?</h4>
            <p>I'm board, and want reddit karma on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful">r/dataisbeautiful</a>. But I am also genuinely curious about what data this will collect.</p>
            <h4>Didn't I already do this?</h4>
            <p>Sort of. I get half way through the school before I somehow lost the data. Seriously, it just vanished. <i>No idea why.</i></p>
            <h4>Don't be concerned</h4>
            <p>This data will not be publically available. It will be stored on a remote server, far away. Also, you are <b>NOT</b> rating your friends. You are just listing people you know. in no paticular order.</p>


            <h4>Lets go (there is a prize at the end)!</h4>
            <p>Please select a random assortment of 6 friends. They do not have to be in any order. Note that is annonomous, but you shouldn't care because this is <i>not</i> a ranking of your best friends.
            <br><br>

            <select id="like-1" class="names" name="names"><option value="none" selected>Select a name</option></select>
            <select id="like-2" class="names" name="names"><option value="none" selected>Select a name</option></select>
            <br>
            <select id="like-3" class="names" name="names"><option value="none" selected>Select a name</option></select>
            <select id="like-4" class="names" name="names"><option value="none" selected>Select a name</option></select>

            <p>Note: I know a few people started the gender transitioning process this year, but since I wasn't there all year, I don't know who. I tried to swap out the deadnames where I knew, but if I missed some, I am deeply sorry.</p>
